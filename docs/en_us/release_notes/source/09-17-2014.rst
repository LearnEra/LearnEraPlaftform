The following information reflects what is new in the edX Platform as of
September 17, 2014. See previous pages in this document for a history of changes.

****************************************
edX Release Announcements Mailing List
****************************************

These edX Course Staff Release Notes are always available and are updated with
each release of the edX Platform on `edx.org`_ and `edX Edge`_.

You can also sign up for the `edX Release Announcements mailing list`_ to get
an email message when we update the edX Course Staff Release Notes.


*******************************
edX Learning Management System
*******************************

* On the **Discussions** tab, an error message sometimes appeared when you clicked through the thread list quickly. This bug has been fixed. 

* In some circumstances, if a student visited a section in the courseware and then left the edX session by closing the browser window, and that section later became unavailable, the student saw a "Page Not Found" error message when she returned to the course. This bug has been fixed. (LMS-6492) 

* If a student changed the playback speed of a video in Firefox, the video did not play. This bug has been fixed. (BLD-1221)


*******************************
edX Studio
*******************************

* The **Adding Files for Your Course** page now includes a recommendation to limit the size of individual files to 10 MB.

* After you added a private YouTube video to your course, the video controls for later videos did not appear in Studio or in the LMS. This bug has been fixed. (TNL-184)

**************************
Coming Soon
**************************

We're pleased to announce the following upcoming change:

* Course teams will soon be able to access data about their courses on a
  dedicated dashboard for course-specific data. By providing insights into who
  your students are, and what they do while interacting with your course, the
  data available on this dashboard can validate choices youâ€™ve made, reveal
  unexpected patterns, and inform plans for changes to the course.


**************************
edX Documentation
**************************

All guides now include a section that lists browsers supported for use with the
edX platform.

The following documentation is available:

* `Building and Running an edX Course`_ 

  Click **Help** in the upper-right corner of any page in the edX Studio
  user interface to access relevant sections in this guide. You can also
  download the entire guide as a PDF.

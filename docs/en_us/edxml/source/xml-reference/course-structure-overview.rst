###############################

Before you begin building your edXML course, you should understand the building
blocks of an edX course.

* Each course starts with a course outline, which contains one or more
  sections.

* Course sections are at the top level of your course and typically represent
  a time period.

* A section contains one or more subsections. Course subsections are parts of a
  section, and usually represent a topic or other organizing principle.

* A subsection contains one or more units.

* Course units are lessons in a subsection that students view as single pages.
  A unit contains one or more components. Course components are objects within
  units that contain your actual course content.
